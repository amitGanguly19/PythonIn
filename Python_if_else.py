# How to use If-else in Python

x = 10
y = 5

if x == y:
    print("Yes, X is Equals to Y")
else:
    print("No, X is not Equals to Y")    


# Is it mandatory to use else block with if?

#a = 50
#if a == 50:
    #print("Yes, A is Equals to  50 !!")
#print("bye !!!")

a = 40

if a == 50:
    print("Yes, A is Equals to  50 !!")
print("bye !!!")
